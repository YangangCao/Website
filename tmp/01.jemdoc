== Bootstrap Aggregating
- bootstrap aggregating is also called bagging
- improve stability and accuracy of machine learning
- aimed at classification and regression
- reduce variance and avoid overfitting
- usually applied to decision tree method
- a special case of the model averaging approach
- can mildly degrade the performance of stable methods such as K-nearest neighbors

==== Bagging algorithm
. given a training set $D$ of size $n$
. by samping uniformly from $D$ with replacement to get $m$ new training set $D_i$ with $n_i \leq n$, where $i \in [1,m]$
. the $m$ models are fitted using the $m$ samples and combined by averaging the output

==== Bootstrap
Procedure is the same as bagging algorithm except when construct $D_i$:
- by samping uniformly from $D$ with replacement to get $m$ new training set $D_i$ with +$n_i=n$+, where $i \in [1,m]$

And without proof, if $n$ is large, the percentage of unique element is going to be $63.2\%$, which is $1-1/e$.

== Python Virtual enviroment
To create a virtuial enviroment
- virtualenv -p PYTHON\_PATH ENV\_PATH
- virtualenv ENV\_PATH (this will use the default python delared in +virtualenv+)

To active the virtual enviroment
- source \/...\/ENV_PATH\/bin\s/active

About source:
- source can be repalced by dot '.'
- reload configuration file

Tip:
- to see package installed: +pip list+ or +conda list+
-
