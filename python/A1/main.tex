\section{Quick Start}
This is an easy part, let's go through these problems!

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is Python?
	
	a programming language
	
	\item Who create it?
	
	Guido van Rossum
	
	\item Any other programming language?
	
	like C, C++, java, javascript(almost nothing to do with java), php, matlab, etc. There are about $600$ languages, their popularity can be checked on TIOBE(The Importance Of Being Earnest, emphasize sincere and professional attitude) programming community index
	
	\item What kind of programming language Python is?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item advance language: more abstract,  less efficient, easier(relative)
		\item dynamic(vs static) language: all are determined during execution, structure and type are mutable
		\item interpreting(vs compiling) language: execute by interpreter during run-time 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Which version to use?
	
	Just use Python 3, it has clear standard and repeated codes are removed
	
	\item Advantages of Python?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item elegant, clear, simple
		\item wildly used in companies: Douban, Google, YouTube, etc
		\item cover many scenarios: backup, back-end, web service, widgets, script, game
		\item relatively easy for developer(less code)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Disadvantages of Python?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item relatively slow: cannot be used for OS level, real-time processing(some cases)
		\item restriction for some areas: iOS, Android, etc
		\item code exposition(may be advantage)
	\end{itemize}

	\item What makes Python easy and fast for development?
	
	mainly because the built-in and third-part library
	
	\item What "run" Python code?
	
	Python interpreter. It's a software written by other language(official default: CPython, may be other)
	
	\item What is operating system?
	
	software that connects the hardware and application
	

\end{enumerate}


\section{Who to Take?}
Hopefully everybody!
