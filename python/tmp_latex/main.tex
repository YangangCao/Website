\section{Python Basics}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item How to use ``del''?\\
del can deleta a variable, in the other word, reference.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Functions}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item How to define a function?\\
Easy\dots
\item How to specify the return type of a function?\\
Use syntax def FUN\_NAME () -> RETURN\_TYPE:
\item Disadvantages of declaration like def func(a=[1,2])?\\
Args are mutable, may cause unpredicted errors!
\end{enumerate}
\section{OOP-Object Oriented Programming}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item What is OOP?\\
Take object as the basic unit for programming, OOP vs procedure-oriented-programming(set of instruction)
\item Why OOP?\\
Everything are objects(a set of objects) and execution becomes the interaction between instances
\item What does an object include?\\
2 parts, properties(data) and methods(functions)
\item Class vs instance?\\
Class is template, instance is the specified class, instance is based on class
\item 3 characteristics of OOP?\\
Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
\item How to add properties to an instance dynamically?\\
Use form instance.var\_name = val to dynamically add a property, this won't work for other instances
\item How to add method to class dynamically?\\
Use form class.method\_name = func\_name, this may arise warning from the IDE
\item What is \_\_slots\_\_ for?\\
A var in class which control the possible property names
\item What is the range of \_\_slots\_\_?\\
Only work for current class, won't work for subclass
\item What is the type of \_\_slots\_\_?\\
It is a tuple
\item What if both a class and its base have \_\_slots\_\_?\\
The possible property will be the union of the two \_\_slots\_\_
\item What is @property for?\\
A decorator which may help us to take a method like property
\item How many ways are there to define class methods?\\
3 ways, regular definition(related to self), decorated by @classmethod(related to cls) and @staticmethod
\item Difference between self and cls?\\
Self is bound to instance of class and cls is bound to class
\item Call of a regular method in a class?\\
Can be called by object but not class, or by class with first arg to be an instance of that class
\item Call of a class method in a class?\\
Can be called by both instance and class directly
\item Call of a static method in a class?\\
Can be called by both instance and class directly
\item Why static method in class instead of an independent func?\\
To indicate that the method belongs to the class and by inheritance, code can be managed better
\item What is MRO?\\
Method resolve order, a mechanism for inheritance
\end{enumerate}
\section{Metaclass}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Biggest difference between static and dynamic language?\\
Static: definition is done during compiling process. Dynamic: definition are created during runtime
\item How class can be defined?\\
Two ways, by general declaration and by type() method
\item How to define a class by type()?\\
Use form CLASS\_NAME = type(`NAME', (BASE\_CLASS,), dic(METHOD1=FUNC1,\dots)), dynamic way to define a class
\item What does type() do?\\
It can show the type of an object. It also can be used to define a class
\item Difference between \_\_new\_\_() and \_\_init\_\_()?\\
\_\_new\_\_() create the obj and \_\_init\_\_() initialize the obj. Initialization comes after creation
\item How class is created(not asking how defined)?\\
During running time, essentially by function type(), tip: not from declaration!!!
\item Difference between general class definition and type()?\\
First one is in static way, the second one can be used in dynamic process, essentially, both share the same purpose
\item Dynamically create a class by static or dynamic language?\\
Easier for dynamic language(itself support), static language requires constructing the source code in the beginning.
\item What is the type of a class?\\
All class name itself has type: ``type''
\item Relationship between type and object?\\
Type is subclass of object, metaclass of object is type. Both are created during the execution of interpreter
\item What is metaclass?\\
An class that controls how another class is defined, can be considered as template for other classes
\item What is the parent class of metaclass?\\
Must be type, cannot be object
\item How class derived from metaclass is created?\\
By calling type.\_\_new\_\_(mcs, name, bases, attrs), it is the return of \_\_new\_\_() function in the metaclass!
\item How metaclass is defined?\\
Name end with Metaclass by convention(not necessary), inherit from type, define \_\_new\_\_() to control how other classes are created
\item What type is name in \_\_new\_\_(mcs, name, bases, attrs)?\\
It is str, who has value of the name of the class that take it as template
\item What type is bases in \_\_new\_\_(mcs, name, bases, attrs)?\\
It is tuple, a tuple that contains the parent classes in the target class
\item What type is attrs in \_\_new\_\_(mcs, name, bases, attrs)?\\
It is dict, has form var\_name: value, var could be either function or properties
\item How are args in \_\_new\_\_(mcs, name, bases, attrs) passed?\\
When interpreter reading a class, it will use type() to create a class, and args are passed in the conventional way
\item Does any class has a corresponding metaclass?\\
Yes, and the metaclass is usually implicitly inherited
\item What is abstract class?(Not that important in python)\\
Class abstraction from many classes with certain similarities, it has a higher abstraction, a template for other classes
\item How to declare an abstract class in python?\\
First from abc import abstractmethod, ABCMeta, then declare a class with arg metaclass=ABCMeta and decorate method with @abstractmethod
\item Characteristics of abstract class?\\
Methods only have declaration, no implementation. Cannot be instantiated. Must have abstract method and must be overridden latter.
\item What is interface class?\\
Like header, can’t be instantiated, only contains method declaration, contains methods, properties, event etc\dots Doesn’t contain constants etc\dots
\end{enumerate}
\section{Enum}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item What is enum class?\\
A enumeration, just list everything, like a key value system linked by equality, usually for constants
\item How to create a enum class?\\
First from enum import Enum, and then create a class inherit from Enum
\item How to get key of enum?\\
Directly use dot ``.'' or by enum\_name[`KEY\_VAL']
\item How to get key value in a enum?\\
By enum.KEY\_VAL.value
\item What is @unique for?\\
Make sure that both key and value won't repeat! (bi-jective)
\item How to import unique?\\
Use statement from enum import unique
\item What is enum generally for?\\
For finding key by value
\end{enumerate}
\section{Error, Debug and Test}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item What is bug?\\
Any unexpected thing, bug must be repaired
\item What causes bug?\\
Programming error, wrong input, unexpected condition(disk is full\dots)
\item What is python pdb?\\
A way of debug, python debug
\item What is error code(value)?\\
When something go wrong, there will be a specific return value like return -1
\item Disadvantages of error code?\\
Mix the error code and general return value together
\item Try, except, else, finally?\\
Try to execute what’s in try, if any error, jump to except and else part will be execute if no error in try, then goes to finally(optional)
\item What if there might be more than a type of error?\\
One try can contain more than one expect block
\item How to write except part?\\
Write form except: or except ERROR\_TYPE as e:
\item Except ZeroDivisionError as e:, what type are they?\\
ZeroDivisionError has type: type since it is a class, e has type:<class `ZeroDivisionError'> since it is an instance of the error class
\item What is the base class of all error classes?\\
All are inherited from BaseException
\item Range of try\dots except works?\\
Function contains it and any outer part that contains them, catch the error at nice position will be okay, don't need to put it everywhere
\item What if error does't caught by any except?\\
It will be thrown upper until caught by Python interpreter to print error and stop the program
\item How to read Traceback (most recent call last):\\
It shows that there are error and goes from top to bottom, the last line show the real reason
\item How to record error?\\
Import logging and add logging.exception(e) to output error and finish the program
\item What essentially an error is?\\
It is an instance of a class
\item How to throw an instance of error?\\
Use raise, need to raise an instance of class that is well designed that inherit from some error class
\item What could raise do if put into the block of except?\\
Convert one error to other type, should be logically reasonable
\item Easiest way of debugging?\\
Use print(), have to delete it after debugging\dots sad
\item Syntax of assert?\\
Have form assert CONDITION, ERROR\_MESSAGE,  condition should be true, otherwise will be error
\item How to stop assert statement during execution?\\
Execute .py file with form \$ python -O xxx.py
\item How to log info?\\
Use form logging.info(STRING)
\item How to config the level of logging?\\
Add code logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) after import logging
\item Level of logging?\\
There are 4: debug, info, warning, error, the higher level you set, the lower cases will be ignored
\item How to start a program by pdb?\\
Use form \$ python -m pdb xxx.py
\item How to see code in pdb?\\
Use command: ``1''
\item How to execute code one line by another?\\
Use command: ``n''
\item How to get value of a var in pdb?\\
Use command: ``p VAR\_NAME''
\item How to quit pdb?\\
Use command: ``q''
\item How to use pdb.set\_trace()?\\
Put it at position where might have error, it will pause the program there , use ``p Var'' to debug and press ``c'' to continue
\item What is the best way of debugging?\\
Ultimately\dots logging
\item What is TDD?\\
Short for Test-Driven-Development
\item What is unit test?\\
Check if a module, function or class work correctly, put all test conditions in a module, after revision, check if all conditions could pass the test
\item Advantage of unit test?\\
It can almost guarantee that the behavior of code is correct
\item What does a test unit class inherit from?\\
From unites.TestCase
\item Purpose of methods in unit test?\\
By convention, methods start with ``test'' are test methods, otherwise not test methods which won't be executed during test
\item What does assertEqual() do?\\
Has form self.assertEqual(abs(-1), 1), check if expected output equals to target output
\item What does assertRaises() do?
Has form with self.assertRaises(ERROR\_TYPE): BLOCK, if do anything in BLOCK, there will be ERROR\_TYPE will be thrown
\item How to run unit test by coding?\\
Directly use statement: unites.main()
\item How to run unit test in console?\\
By command: python -m unittest xxx.py
\item What are setUp() and tearDown() functionality?\\
They will be executed before and after a test
\item Which module is used for doc test?\\
Use import doctest
\item How to run doc test?\\
Use statement doctest.testmod()
\item Where the doc test code should be?\\
Within the triple comments: ``````xxx''''''
\item How to write test doc?\\
All statement start with $>>>$ STATEMENT(could be more than one) and then the next line follow the output
